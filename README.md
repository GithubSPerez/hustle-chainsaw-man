# Chainsaw Man for Y.O.M.I. Hustle
This is a character mod for the game with all Aseprite files included in case you want to contribute some moves.

# Editing
**You'll need the decompiled YOMI Hustle project to make changes. More info at https://discord.gg/yomimodding**
- Create a new folder at the root of your project called "chainsaw"
- Clone the contents of this repo to that folder
- On Global.gd add `"Chainsaw Man":"res://chainsaw/char/Chainsaw.tscn"` to the name_paths dictionary

# Terms
You can make PR's to contribute moves and this is the method I prefer to continue the character. All of the Aseprite files are available so following
the original style shouldn't be difficult.

Otherwise, if you decide to share your own fork publically as a Workshop item please follow these:

- Give credit (not only to me, but anyone that might have contributed as well)
- Don't use the same directory name as the main mod, this means anything but "chainsaw" is good (otherwise it will cause issues between versions).
- Preferably use a different **name AND thumbnail** for the item as to not generate confusion
